He was my pen pal seven years ago.
Here’s your milk.
You mean our milk you borrowed three weeks ago.
What’s she like?
Tough guy
Why don’t I show you how to do it properly!
I’ve told you before, nobody uses my bike, nobody, is that clear?
If you touch my bike again, you are out
come in!
He brought our milk back from three weeks ago
You live in a museum, full of old things
Charley, there you are
I’m off, I owe two week’s rent!

leave it to me
I would like a pair of trousers please.
Who’s that?
I don’t believe you.
Try it on.

How dare you
