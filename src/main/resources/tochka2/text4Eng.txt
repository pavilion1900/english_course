Last year I had a business trip to Italy.
And it was awesome
Basically, now I want a gorgeous vacation there!
Last week I booked a gorgeous hotel room and the tickets.
My destination is Rome.
So I am going to get tanned! You won’t even recognize me!
I am going to have a city tour
After that, I’ll go for a walk, I like to go sightseeing on my own
Rome is gorgeous! I love the tourist attractions there.
I hope I won’t have problems at the baggage claim area.
I hope the guides will speak English or Russian… and it won’t sound like Chinese… )))
Otherwise, I'll need a guide book
Oh! I forgot the time of my arrival! I am going to check it.
