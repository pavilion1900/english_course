We want some adventures. Preferably, the good ones.
My friend is on vacation, why is she at the office?
I want to travel abroad at least once … a week!
He is so arrogant! He talks like he is a king or something!
We are very responsible, we don’t postpone important things.
They are shy, they don’t talk to anyone.
I always eat out, when I travel abroad
Easy-going people usually like adventures
