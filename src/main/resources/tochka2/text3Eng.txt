My parents decorate their flat all the time!
I think, I am following their footsteps…
Your living room is really nice and cozy!
I wanted this sofa, but I changed my mind!
I feel protected ad home
It’s like the walls of my house protect me.
The design is not that good… but it’s temporary, so it’s ok.
My friends are preparing to do a renovation at their country house
I like your new flat, except for the kitchen!
I have many thoughts about our future renovation!
Except you are not interested in it
I’m sure, that new furniture will make our room cozy
