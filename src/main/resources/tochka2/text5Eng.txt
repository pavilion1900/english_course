I have already let her leave
I have already thought about it
I have already kept a secret
I have already lost my keys
I have already tried French wine
I have already taken the course
I have already driven a motorbike
I have already forgotten everything
I have already spoken to her
I have already written the words
I have already gone there
I have already drunk Coke with lime
I have already come home
I have already fallen asleep
I have already begun to worry
I have already won the competition
I have already worn these jeans
I have already broken the promise
I have already called my friend
I have already watched this movie
I have already broken the promise
I have already come to the office
I have already begun to worry
I have already forgotten about it
I have already thought about it
My neighbor drives me crazy!
This music drives me crazy!
This situation drives me crazy!
My laziness drives me crazy!

This mess drives me crazy!
My boss drives me crazy!
The traffiс jam drives me crazy!
This noise drives me crazy!
This situation drives me crazy!

Have you found your soul mate?
As for me, I think I am really lucky.
I believe that my best friend is my soul mate
She has always been sincere with me!
We started to get on well in early childhood.
I truly admire her!
My best friend is a housewife, but she has raised two kids, and that is a great achievement
She is the most responsible person I’ve ever seen in my entire life!
Actually, we need to make the effort to improve any relationship!
Do you try to keep in touch with the people you like?
Excuse me. Are you… texting me?!
