I always go for a walk with my rabbits.
We travel twice a year to Guatemala.

Do you want to buy new gorilla?
This street is so beautiful.
I love this city very much.
How often do you ask for directions?
I don`t think it is safe to sleep on the street.
My city is very sunny.
It is always rainy in Saint Petersburg.
I hate snowy weather. I want to live in Africa!
